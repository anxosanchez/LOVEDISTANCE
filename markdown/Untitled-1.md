# Frustrations with  word processors

* Most teachers I know fall into one of two camps: **Microsoft Word** (old generation) **Google Docs** (new generation)
* Both are terrible, especially in a world where thereâ€™s Markdown.
* When we want share with students we use **PDF** formt (Adobe Corporation)
* Make presentations with **Powerpoint**, **Impress** or **Google Slides** ...
* and share them in **PDF** ...

Try too convert MS Word doc into a Powerpoint Presentation and then share it in **PDF**!
