# Teachers Perception

 * They have 'tendency to compare' the relevance and quality of online materials with Books.
 * The study reflects need of awareness programmes for teacher educators on OER and its utilization. 
 * Curation is needeed to adjudicate the credence and quality of the materials.

# Curation vs Creation Dilema

* You mostly likely already engage in a mix of content creation and content curation.
* Content creation is when you create your own materials from scratch—from syllabi, presentations, assignments and assessments.
* You realize that you’re a one-stop shop education machine!.
* You don’t write your own new course materials every semester. 
* Instead, you think about the use of existing content where it suits your needs.

# What to do?

* Skip some readings and borrow material from a past semester. This is content curation.
* Balancing content creation with curation makes course design more effective.
* Content curation means take resources developed by trusted sources and use them in their own classes.
* Curation is just one educational tool.
* Research shows that curation also improves student success while keeping student costs low with free or affordable supplemental materials.
* Curating high-quality content prevents you from unnecessarily duplicating content (MMOER).

* Consider collaborating with others

# Recommendations

- Limit the amount of copyrighted materials posted to Moodle

- Use links to legal copies of materials, rather than creating and uploading copies to Moodle. Reasons linking is preferable include:

- Consider this a teachable moment: teach to find

- Using films and music within Moodle carefully

- Delete copyrighted content after the class ends
